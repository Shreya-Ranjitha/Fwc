## About

I applied for the Summer Research Fellowship Programme (SRFP) offered by the Indian Academy of Sciences (IASc) during my third semester. After submitting my application with academic details and a statement of purpose, I was thrilled to receive my selection letter in March. I was assigned to work under the guidance of Dr. GVV Sharma at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. This internship has been a great opportunity to dive deeper into research and practical problem-solving. This repository serves as a portfolio of my internship work, documenting my progress, solutions, and notes as I complete assignments and projects related to digital design.
