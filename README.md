## About

I applied for the Summer Research Fellowship Programme (SRFP) offered by the Indian Academy of Sciences (IASc) during my third semester. After submitting my application with academic details and a statement of purpose, I was thrilled to receive my selection letter in March. I was assigned to work under the guidance of Dr. GVV Sharma at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Hyderabad. This internship has been a great opportunity to dive deeper into research and practical problem-solving. This repository serves as a portfolio of my internship work, documenting my progress, solutions, and notes as I complete assignments and projects related to digital design.

## Setup Details

This project follows the same setup used in Prof. G.V.V. Sharma’s [FWC repository](https://github.com/gadepall/fwc-1?tab=readme-ov-file). All required packages, toolchains, and instructions for Termux-based development are listed there.

You can also refer to the digital design book and supporting material using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gadepall/digital-design
```

## PlatformIO

PlatformIO is an open-source ecosystem for embedded development. It simplifies compiling and uploading firmware to microcontrollers like the ATmega328P.

---

### 1. Create or Open a PlatformIO Project

Use PlatformIO CLI to create a new project:

```bash
pio project init --board atmega328p
```

> Replace `atmega328p` with your actual board ID. Use `pio boards` to list available options.

---

### 2. Write Your Firmware in `src/main.cpp`

Example:

```cpp
#include <avr/io.h>
#include <util/delay.h>

int main(void) {
    DDRB |= (1 << PB0); // Set PB0 as output

    while (1) {
        PORTB ^= (1 << PB0); // Toggle LED
        _delay_ms(500);
    }
}
```

---

### 3. Configure `platformio.ini`

Edit the `platformio.ini` file in the root directory of your project:

```ini
[env:atmega328p]
platform = atmelavr
board = atmega328p
framework = arduino
upload_protocol = custom
upload_command = avrdude -v -p m328p -c usbasp -U flash:w:.pio/build/atmega328p/firmware.hex:i
```

---

### 4. Build the Project

Use PlatformIO to compile the firmware:

```bash
pio run
```

---

### 5. Upload the Firmware

Make sure your board is connected to your android device and upload the code using Arduino Droid.

### Assignment
GATE EE-2017,36 - A 10½ digit timer counter possesses a base clock of frequency 100 MHz. When measuring a
particular input, the reading obtained is the same in: (i) Frequency mode of operation with a gating
time of one second and (ii) Period mode of operation (in the x 10 ns scale). The frequency of the
unknown input (reading obtained) in Hz is _________. 
Ans: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Implementation: A digital timer counter based on a frequency of 100Hz is difficult to visualise. A 5Hz-based counter was implemented. Pin 8 is toggled, generating a pulse every 200ms for this purpose. The pulse was visualised using a led initially. Number of pulses were also counted using a 7 segment display later.

Code:
```bash
#include <Arduino.h>

volatile uint16_t pulseCount = 0;
uint8_t displayValue = 0;
unsigned long lastUpdate = 0;
unsigned long lastPulseTime = 0;

void countPulse() {
    pulseCount++;
}

void setup() {
    pinMode(2, INPUT);                         // Pulse input
    attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(2), countPulse, RISING);

    for (int i = 4; i <= 7; i++) {
        pinMode(i, OUTPUT);                    // Binary display output
    }

    pinMode(8, OUTPUT);                        // Pulse generation output
}

void loop() {
    // Generate a pulse every 200 ms on pin 8
    if (millis() - lastPulseTime >= 200) {
        digitalWrite(8, HIGH);
        delayMicroseconds(10);  // short HIGH pulse (~10 microseconds)
        digitalWrite(8, LOW);
        lastPulseTime = millis();
    }

    // Every 1 second, display pulse count % 10 on binary pins 4–7
    if (millis() - lastUpdate >= 1000) {
        noInterrupts();
        displayValue = pulseCount % 10;
        pulseCount = 0;
        interrupts();

        digitalWrite(4, displayValue & 0x01);
        digitalWrite(5, (displayValue >> 1) & 0x01);
        digitalWrite(6, (displayValue >> 2) & 0x01);
        digitalWrite(7, (displayValue >> 3) & 0x01);

        lastUpdate = millis();
    }
}

```
